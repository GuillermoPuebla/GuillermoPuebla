My work focuses on relational reasoning and generalization in humans and artificial intelligence systems. I study these issues through experiments with humans and simulations with computational models of the cognitive processes involved in these tasks. Lately, my work as focused on exploring the relational reasoning capabilities of deep neural networks.
